	<h1>Hong Konooggggg!!!!!</h1>
	<hr>
	<h2>Hong Kong Skyline</h2>
<p>Hong Kong has one of the most impressive and recognizable skylines in the world. The dense collection of skyscrapers, both on the island of Hong Kong and in Kowloon, combined with the surrounding mountains and harbor set this city apart. In the harbor, traditional red-sailed Chinese junk boats and the historic Star Ferry contrast sharply with the backdrop of modern high-rises. At night, the skyline changes character completely as the sky darkens and the city lights fill the scene. Two of the best places in Hong Kong to see the skyline are from the top of Victoria Peak or from the Kowloon waterfront (along the Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade near the clock tower), not far from the Star Ferry dock, where benches line the waterfront and look across to Hong Kong. The latter location is the best place to watch the nightly A Symphony of Lights laser and light show set to music.</p>
<h2>Victoria Peak (The Peak)</h2>
<p>You haven't seen the best of Hong Kong until you've taken in the skyline from Victoria Peak, more commonly known as The Peak. Ride the tram to the top of this scenic viewpoint to see the skyscrapers, bustling city, harbor, and surrounding islands. The tram station is located near the entrance to Hong Kong Park by the Murray building. At the top of the tram are the Peak Tower and Peak Galleria, with shops, restaurants, and an observation deck. Most of The Peak is covered by a large park with lush greenery, nature trails, and more beautiful lookouts with views over the thriving metropolis below. A trail also leads down from The Peak to the city below, following a mix of trails through the forest and sections of road here and there. It can be a bit confusing finding your way. See our article on Hong Kong hiking trails for more details.</p>
<h2>Big Buddha (Tian Tan Buddha Statue)</h2>
<p>The 34-meter-high "Big Buddha" sits above Lantau Island's Po Lin monastery, which was a fairly secluded place until the statue was built in 1993. This is one of the largest Buddha statues of its kind in the world and took 12 years to complete. The size is astounding, both up close and seen from a distance. The setting here is also incredible, surrounded by the green forest and views out over the ocean and islands. Although you can take a bus, the best way to reach the Buddha is via the scenic Ngong Ping cable car, which takes you on a 5.7-kilometer, 25-minute ride over forest, water, and mountains. The ride terminates at the small tourist-focused Ngong Ping Village, which you'll have to walk through before reaching the monastery and Big Buddha.</p>
<h2>Wong Tai Sin Temple</h2>
<p>The Wong Tai Sin Temple is one of the newest in Hong Kong and also one of the most interesting. Located in Kowloon, the original temple was a private structure built in 1920. It was later replaced with a newer building in 1968, which is what visitors see today. The temple was built to honor the Taoist god Wong Tai Sin, whom locals regard as the bringer of good luck in horse-racing and a healer of illnesses. A festival is held at the temple in Wong Tai Sin's name each fall.

The temple complex is made up of several buildings, including the Hall of Three Saints, the Good Wish Garden, and another hall dedicated to Confucius and his 72 disciples. Expect to see fortune-tellers in the large hall, as well as joss sticks and other offerings that visitors can use. It is customary for guests to leave a small donation toward the temple's maintenance.</p>
<h2>Repulse Bay and the Beaches</h2>
<p>Not everyone thinks of beaches when they think of Hong Kong, but you don't have to go far to find some incredible soft-sand beach. The beach at Repulse Bay is the most popular in all of Hong Kong, with beautiful views and a great place for swimming, although it's very non touristy. A day spent here is complemented with the luxury and style typical of Hong Kong itself. The street running along the oceanfront and overlooking the wide beach is lined with trendy restaurants and shops. Amalfitana is fun place to enjoy a pizza, with casual open-air dining looking over the beach.

Another nearby spot for a day at the beach is Big Wave Bay. Here, the water rolls in relatively gently to a large U-shaped cove with a splendid beach. This is a much more relaxed and casual atmosphere than at Repulse Bay. A popular outing is to walk part of the famous Dragon's Back hike to Big Wave Bay and dip in the ocean for a swim. At the back of the beach, barbecues are often serving up seafood and other tasty treats. Buses and taxis are available to take you back to the city. Also worth checking out is scenic Shek O Beach. It's easily accessible via public transit. For more details see our article on the best beaches in Hong Kong.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Disneyland</h2>
<p>Hong Kong Disneyland is located on Lantau Island. Here, you'll find a wonderful world filled with fun and fantasy populated with the cast and characters from Disney movies. The park is divided into seven lands: Adventureland; Fantasyland; Toy Story Land; Tomorrowland; Grizzly Gulch; Mystic Point; and Main Street, U.S.A. Performances happen throughout the day in the various lands and feature everything from parades to musicals, right through to evening fireworks over the castle. Also on offer are a wide array of adventures, ranging from Jungle cruises to a trip to Tarzan's Treehouse, as well as water-based fun at Liki Tiki.</p>
<h2>Tai O Fishing Village</h2>
<p>A visit to Tai O village offers an experience you won't find anywhere else in Hong Kong. Although it is a popular place to visit for tourists, it is a far cry from the busy city, crowded markets, and theme parks. Tai O is home to people who live a quieter, more traditional way of life. The Tanka people who live in Tai O, found on Lantau Island, build their homes on stilts over tidal flats. Villagers offer boat rides around the village, after which you can visit the local markets and sample some of the fresh seafood. Occasional sightings of the endangered pink dolphin occur in the nearby waters. Many people visit Tai O village after they've made the journey up to the Big Buddha.</p>
<h2>Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery
</h2>
<p>Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery, located in Sha Tin, offers a beautiful and peaceful escape from the bustle of central Hong Kong and a look at the countryside. Set on a hilltop, the main access to the monastery is reached by walking up a long and curving set of stairs (approximately 400 steps), lined with hundreds of golden statues. The walk is part of the attraction, and each of the statues is unique, many with quirky facial expressions and other interesting characteristics. Once at the top, the path opens into the square in front of the main temple, a welcome sight both because it's the end of the climb and for the impressive structures and statues that surround the open space.</p>
<h2>Chi Lin Nunnery and Nan Lian Garden</h2>
<p>This Buddhist temple dates to the 1930s but was rebuilt in the 1990s in traditional Tang Dynasty style. The structures are all made of wood, and the large complex is incredibly impressive. In front of the complex are carefully sculpted bonsai trees surrounding the Lotus Pond Garden, with several ponds featuring water lilies. The Chi Lin Nunnery and the nearby Nan Lian Garden are located in Diamond Hill, in Kowloon. To reach the site, take the MTR Kwun Tong Line to Diamond Hill Station, Exit C2.</p>
<h2>Tsim Sha Tsui</h2>
<p>Tsim Sha Tsui, known more commonly as TST, is a shopping and entertainment hub at the southern point of Kowloon and offers a real taste of what Hong Kong has to offer. The Tsim Sha Tsui district is a melting pot of culture and commerce that speaks to the heart of Hong Kong. Nathan Road is the main artery running through the area, where you'll find numerous restaurants, boutiques, and other unique vendors. If you're looking for the world-class luxury Hong Kong promises, you can find high-end retailers on nearby Canton Road. At the southern end of the neighborhood, you'll find the Clock Tower, a Hong Kong landmark. Nearby, the Tsim Sha Tsui Cultural Complex is the premier cultural center in the country and includes tourist attractions such as the Hong Kong Space Museum and the Hong Kong Museum of Art. In the evening, the waterfront is the perfect place to watch the nightly light show, lighting up the sky and skyscrapers across the harbor.</p>
