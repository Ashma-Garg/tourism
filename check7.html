<h2>Christoffel National Park</h2>
<img src="GettyImages-112837549_master.jpg">
<p>This 1800-hectare preserve is formed from three old plantations, including the Savonet Plantation (now the excellent Savonet Museum; combination ticket available). The park has two driving routes and eight hiking trails, which provide a variety of perspectives on the island's landscape, flora and fauna. It takes two to three hours to hike to the summit of Christoffel Mountain (375m), the island's highest point. You'll want to bring plenty of water and get an early start – 11am at the latest.</p>
<h2>Queen Emma Bridge</h2>
<img src="GettyImages-541321363_master.jpg">
<p>Spanning the Sint Annabaai, this local landmark is sometimes called Our Swinging Old Lady. It's a pontoon bridge that swings open to make way for oceangoing ships. When the bridge is open, two free public ferries shuttle passengers back and forth between Punta and Otrobanda.</p>

<h2>Grote Knip</h2>
<p>This west-end beach is a stunner. In fact, you've probably seen it on the cover of a Curaçao tourist brochure. A perfect crescent of brilliant white sand is framed by azure waters and verdant hills. There are a few snack shacks and places to rent snorkel gear, but it's much less cluttered than the island's private beaches.</p>
<h2>Gallery Alma Blou</h2>
<p>Housed in the 17th-century plantation house Landhuis Habaai, this cooperative gallery has the city's largest collection of works by local artists. The rotating exhibits usually feature one or two artists with local connections, but there's always a great variety of works on display, including whimsical sculptures in the courtyard and gardens. Located about 3km northwest of Otrobanda.</p>
<h2>Flamingo Sanctuary</h2>
<p>For an island that's lacking in lawns, there is no shortage of pink flamingos. You'll see them congregating in the Saliña Sint Marie, the salt flats on the southern side of the road heading toward Playa Portomari. There are several places to pull off the road, but be sure to lock your car when you go to get a better look at the wading beauties (whose numbers can vary greatly, anywhere from a dozen to hundreds).</p>
